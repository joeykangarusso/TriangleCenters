# TriangleCenters

Use the function findTriangle to find the vertices of a triangle given its triangle centers.

As input, findTriangle accepts 8 parameters in the following order: (xy_low, xy_high, Ce_x, Ce_y, I_x, I_y, Ci_x, Ci_y, O_x, O_y). They are defined thusly:
  xy_low  =   low range of x- and y-values for your search
  xy_high =   high range of x- and y-values for your search
  Ce_x    =   x-value of centroid
  Ce_y    =   y-value of centroid
  I_x     =   x-value of incenter
  I_y     =   y-value of incenter
  Ci_x    =   x-value of circumcenter
  Ci_y    =   y-value of circumcenter
  O_x     =   x-value of orthocenter
  O_y     =   y-value of orthocenter
